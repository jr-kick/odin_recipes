# odin_recipes
Greetings, fellow web-developers!

This is a project of mine created to showcase my knowledge I gathered
during my course in the Odin Project. In this basic html webpage I'll
make a standard boilerplate that consists of a body that has lists
of recipes and also images of the food that we are making.

It's just a very basic website yet that I will further develope in
the future with some css coding to make it look fancy. I hope you
will like it.

Have fun!
