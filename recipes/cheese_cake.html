        <h3>Best Chinese Noodles Recipe Ever</h3>
        <p>With this recipe, a creamy, gorgeous, crack-free New York-style cheesecake is totally doable, even for beginners!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 tbsp vegetable or peanut oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>500g noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>

                Wrap the springform pan with one large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, covering the underside of the pan and extending all the way to the top. Repeat with another sheet of foil for insurance. Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li><p>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt.
                <p>Stir until well combined.</p>
                <p>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour.</p>
                <p>Beat on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined.</p>
                <p>Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Set the unbaked cheesecake in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes about one inch up the side of the cake pan. The water bath (also called a bain marie) regulates the temperature and keeps the cheesecake baking at an even, low heat. The steam/humidity created by the water bath also protects the cheesecake from drying out and cracking.</p></li>
            <li>Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath, discard the foil, and transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
